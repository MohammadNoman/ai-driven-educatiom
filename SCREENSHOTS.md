# Killer Screenshots for Submission

## 1. The "Context-Aware" Trigger
**Description:** A user highlighting the definition of "Spec-Kit Plus" in Chapter 3. A sleek, floating "Ask AI" button (with the Sparkles icon) is hovering right next to the cursor, demonstrating tight UI integration.

## 2. The "Live" Conversation
**Description:** The Chat Widget is open. The user asked "How does this relate to RAG?". The AI response is visible with two key features:
1. A "Sources: Chapter 3" citation pill.
2. A green "Verified by ReflectionAgent" checkmark at the bottom.

## 3. The Spec-Kit Foundation
**Description:** A split-screen view. On the left, the `rag-agent-spec.md` file showing the YAML configuration. On the right, the Mermaid diagram from Chapter 6 rendered in the browser, matching the spec exactly.

## 4. The Reflection Loop
**Description:** A backend log view (or a specific debug UI) showing the ReflectionAgent's analysis:
`Grounding Score: 0.92 | Pedagogy Score: 0.88 | Status: PASSED`.
This proves the multi-agent architecture is real.

## 5. The Green Pipeline
**Description:** The GitHub Actions summary page showing all checks passed:
- ✅ Build Docusaurus
- ✅ Deploy to Pages
- ✅ Trigger Qdrant Ingestion
Captures the "Production-Ready" aspect of the hackathon.
