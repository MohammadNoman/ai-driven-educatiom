This section documents the system architecture used to power this very book's chatbot.

## Spec-Kit Plus: RAG Agent
The following specification defines the behavior of the Ingestion, Query, and Reflection agents.
```yaml title="specs/rag-agent-spec.yaml"
project: "panaversity-rag-agent"
stack:
  backend: "FastAPI"
  vector_db: "Qdrant Cloud"
  llm: "OpenAI GPT-4o"

agents:
  - name: IngestionAgent
    skill: education-embedding-skill
    config: { chunk_size: 1000, overlap: 200 }
  
  - name: QueryAgent
    instructions: "Prioritize selected context. Cite chapters."
  
  - name: ReflectionAgent
    trigger: "post-response"
    criteria: "Grounding Score > 0.7"
```

## FastAPI Backend
We use a lightweight FastAPI wrapper to orchestrate the agents. View `backend/main.py` in the repository for full source.

## React Widget
The floating widget detects `window.getSelection()` events to enable context-aware queries.
