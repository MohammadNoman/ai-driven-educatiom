Faculty roles are shifting from **Knowledge Dispensers** to **Learning Architects**.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify the three phases of faculty evolution.
- Understand the "Human-in-the-Loop" necessity.
- Draft a personal transition plan.

## Faculty AI Maturity Model

| Level | Name | Description | Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AI-Aware | Ad-hoc use of AI tools. | Faculty uses ChatGPT for basic drafting., Students use AI for homework assistance (often unguided)., No formal policy. |
| 2 | AI-Assisted | AI integrated into workflows. | Faculty uses structured prompts., Assignments designed with AI in mind., Basic RAG used for course search. |
| 3 | AI-Native | Curriculum redesigned for AI. | Live Books with embedded agents., Personalized learning paths., Evaluation via AI simulation. |
| 4 | AI-Symbiotic | Co-evolution of human/AI. | Recursive self-improvement of course material., Autonomous student agents., Global knowledge mesh integration. |

## The Automation Paradox
As AI automates content generation, the value of *curation* and *mentorship* skyrockets. We use Python agents to handle the drudgery.

```python title="faculty_agent.py"
class FacultyAssistant:
    def __init__(self, vector_store):
        self.knowledge_base = vector_store
        
    def draft_syllabus(self, topic: str, level: str) -> str:
        """Generates a spec-driven syllabus draft."""
        context = self.knowledge_base.query(f"Standard curriculum for {topic}")
        return f"Generated Syllabus for {topic} ({level}) based on {len(context)} sources."
```
